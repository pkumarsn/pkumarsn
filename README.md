## Key Imapct Projects

### Pseudolite System
Designed a navigation system that transmits GPS-like signals for independent navigation. This project required complex signal processing and hardware integration, using a 10-layer PCB with around 700 components, including two FPGAs and two digital signal processors.

### GPS Receiver
Performed hardware testing, firmware programming, and environmental testing on a GPS receiver capable of tracking up to 10 satellites and providing fast position solutions.

### Room controllers
Worked on multiple controller PCB designs, covering everything from requirements to production support and ongoing maintenance. I selected MCUs through DAR, ensuring they met all requirements, and coordinated with software, quality, testing, mechanical, production, and procurement teams.

### Reference Receiver Interface Card
Developed an interface card for data communication via Ethernet, USB, and UART. It collected and managed navigation data efficiently for critical aerospace applications.

### Intel Galileo SmartCity Project
Worked on the hardware design for a SmartCity project utilizing Intel Galileo, interfacing various sensors and modules for IoT-based applications.
